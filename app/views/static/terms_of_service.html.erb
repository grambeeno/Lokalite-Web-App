<h1>Terms of Service</h1> 
 
<p>Last revised on 2/10/2011</p> 
 
<h3>The Gist</h3> 
 
<p><strong>lokalite</strong> operates the <strong>lokalite</strong> service, which we hope you use. If you use it, please use it responsibly. If you don't, we'll have to terminate your account.</p> 
 
<p>The Terms of Service, <strong>lokalite</strong> itself, and our service can change at any time. We'll try to warn registered users about major changes to the Terms of Service or <strong>lokalite</strong>, but we make no guarantees.</p> 
 
<p>That's the basic idea, but you must read through the entire Terms of Service below and agree with all the details before you use this service for any purpose.</p>
