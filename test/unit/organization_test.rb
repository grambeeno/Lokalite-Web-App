    #      :description => "Established in 1995, Twisted Pine Brewing Company produces only 100% natural, unpasteurized pure malt ales, batch brewed and hand-crafted.  We maintain a strong local presence and feel proud that our beers capture the full flavor and variety of style found at our brewery. It is our intention to bring to you a select family of individually distinctive ales that we as brewers would enjoy drinking ourselves. That is our final measure. We ignore costs, fads, and difficulty in creating our ales. And, while we are very serious about the art and business of beer making, we try to avoid taking ourselves too seriously. After all, we realize brewing a fine beer isn't exactly nuclear physics. It's something far more important.",
